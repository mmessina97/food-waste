# Analysis Purpose

## Available Datasets
- [Food Waste per Capita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/food-waste-per-capita)
- [Average Years of Schooling](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-years-of-schooling)
- [GDP per Capita (World Bank)](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth)

## Objective
This analysis aims to identify which countries produce the most food waste in relation to GDP per capita* and the average level of education.

## Questions to Answer
- Are richer countries wasting the most food?
- Are more educated people wasting more food?
- Do higher GDP and higher education influence the way we consume and preserve food?

## Results
Countries with higher GDP and higher average years of schooling tend to waste less food. According to the data, we can conclude that higher income per capita and better education can positively contribute to preventing food waste.

## Conclusion
Unfortunately, we observe a paradox: poorer countries, which have fewer resources, are the ones struggling the most to prevent food waste.
